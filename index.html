    Hello, my name is Andrew Yeung a quick snippet about me is that im a big fan of hiking<br>
    the picture above shows Lake Garibaldi in the first week of May 2020 with over 2ft of snow.<br>
    I've done the hike every year since 2015 on the first weekend of May when the trail opens; doing the hike <br>
    in the snow is physically demanding but in my opinion the climb is very rewarding.<br>
    Some other facts about me, I'm currently in my 4th year at UFV in the Computing Science program<br>
    I previously got up to my 4th year in Biology but the content wasn't keeping me interested so I switched.
